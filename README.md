# Godot Metaballs
An implementation of both 2D and 3D metaballs in godot

- 2D metaballs were made with [this method](https://john-wigg.dev/2DMetaballs/), using blurred images and a simple texture shader

- 3D metaballs were made with [this method](https://github.com/SebLague/Ray-Marching/tree/master), using ray-marching and a compute shader
